# c-ogl-test
Quick and diry experiment to do some plain OpenGL from C

This is by far not the cleanest code, this was just a quick experiment to lay down the basics of drawing 3D objects via OpenGL and getting a first, simple GLSL shader working.

This is/was supposed to be the base for
- making a 64k demo (need to get of glfw and glew, for that)
- the new Viewergames-Racing Twitch Extension, that features a completely own WebGL 3D renderer
